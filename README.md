# Load Shedding

A Home Assistant integration to track your load schedding schedule.

1. Download and unzip to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > + Add Integration
4. Search for 'Load Shedding' and follow the config flow.
5. If you're coming from a previous version of this integration, you may need to delete the `.json` files in `/config/.cache`.

# Automation Ideas
1. Announce Load Shedding stage changes on speakers and push notifications.
2. Give a last rounds call for coffee 15 minutes before load shedding starts.
3. Dim lights or turn off devices before load shedding and turn them back on afterwards.
